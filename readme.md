# Project Information

### Project Proposal
To create a complete and unique virtual reality (VR) experience.

### Vision Statement
Whereas locomotion in virtual reality (VR) is difficult to realize in a comfortable way, and whereas currently implemented methods of movement in VR could be improved upon, this project seeks to implement a relatively unused form of movement in VR with the goal of creating an entertaining and pleasant VR experience.

### Premise
Arachnid Guy: The premise is to have a spider-like superhero able to create spider webs upon which they can climb along in VR. This climbing is the main vision of the game and is the major feature of the game that sets it apart from both VR and standard desktop games as webs can be generated from any allowed surface to any allowed surface within a distance limit. Beyond just creating webs to climb on Arachnid Guy has other powers to help solve puzzles, defeat evildoers, and save the day.
